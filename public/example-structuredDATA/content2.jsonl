During the early to mid twentieth century this application of art was termed \"styling\" and again referred to the aesthetic aspect of an object.

As the celebrated Italian designer Vico Magistretti noted, the difference between design and styling is that \"design does not need drawing, but styling does\" - by which he meant that design could be described through spoken or written words, while styling has to be, as he put it, \"expressed by the most exact drawings, not because it disregards fun"}

Of course, the formation of these links between quality and utility would help to change taste and therefore demand over the coming years, eventually spurring a new proto-modernity in design the following decade.

It was the first cultural movement to distance itself from nature and instead glorify the energetic flux of the metropolis. To this end, Futurist designers such as Fortunato Depero used fragmented Cubist-like forms as a means of evoking a sense of speed and acceleration.

The idea for this post-war school of design was first mooted at a meeting held in 1947 between the Bauhaus-trained Swiss designer Max Bill and the German graphic designer Otl Aicher and his future wife, Inge Scholl, who had been a leading member of the non-violent Weiße Rose (White Rose) resistance group during the war.

Yet fermenting under the surface was the Italian Radical Design movement, which had emerged during the late 196os and now had a lot more to rail against, in the midst of such banality in mass-produced objects.

The American furniture manufacturer Knoll produced a collection designed by Robert Venturi and his wife and partner Denise Scott Brown. With his famous quip that was a take on Mies van der Rohe, “Less is a Bore”, Venturi was one of the earliest and most important proponents of Postmodernism; his seminal book Learning from Las Vegas: The Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form (1972), co-written with Scott Brown and Steven Izenour, had become required reading for architects and designers, notleast for controversially lauding the garish cultural honesty of the Las Vegas Strip and exploring the idea of architecture"}

Although these books offer intriguing glimpses of better ways of designing and making products, the reality is that most goods that are manufactured are far removed from these ideals. In north-east China, the city of Shenyang-like so many of China's industrial hubs-has skies filled with thick smog as factories belch a toxic cocktail, churning out all manner of ephemeral products, from"}

In fact,there is very little difference between the shoddy goods found in Shenyang and those that were displayed at the Great Exhibition of 1851, except that the scale of production is now infinitely greater and, as a result, the environmental impact infinitely worse. SOME CONCLUDING THOUGHTS AIthough the economic downturn that began in 2007 has somewhat curbed excessive consumption and helped to focus some designers on satisfying real needs there still exists a wanton amount of waste; resources are squandered and consumers encouraged to update and replace their possessions with starling frequency Sustainability is about reusing, reducing and recycling, and can be achieved by making very small"}

In such an environment there is a distinct glimmer of hope for design reform, because when people have access to well-designed products they become more discerning in their purchases, and so Good Design effectively breeds Good Design.

Sometimes, though, it is difficult to determine whether a design is really good. Take, for example, the iPhone-a small yet perfectly formed device that is the quintessential design of the present era. Its functional clarity and user-friendly interface are reminiscent of the pioneering work of Dieter Rams for Braun, and its alluring, sleek form is as seductive as any design by Raymond Loewy; then, Apple's frequent upgrading would have trumped even Harley Earl, tarnishing the existing model by introducing a new look and enhanced capability. More than any other design, the iPhone demonstrates the convergence of technologies, elegantly combining a host of functions that only a few years ago would have been served by a variety of separate products, from music"}

The iPhone also encapsulates the other main themes of contemporary design practice, among them universal solutions that can be subject to mass customization, haptic feedback that engenders emotional response and, lastly but by no means least, intuitive interfacing connections.

What, then, will our own design legacy say about us?"}
